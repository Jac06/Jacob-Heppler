# **RADICAL COOL KID ROM COLLECTION**
  
Feel free to add any roms or folders to the dropbox.  **If you upload a ROM rename it to just the game title**

After downloading a rom from the dropbox, upload it to afterplay, where you can then access it on any device.  

We recommend saving after big events in any of your ROMs, because although afterplay.io auto saves it can occasionally log you off and you can not log back in due to the school ipads. There is a video showing how to download save files in this folder.
  
afterplay.io supports these consoles with a free account:  
Game Boy  
Game Boy Color  
Game Boy Advance  
SNES  
  
Other consoles need a trial or premium account. **These may not work on the school network

**DOWNLOAD ROMS:** https://r-roms.github.io (Harder to navigate than most ROM sites, but poses significantly less risk of downloading something harmful. Blocked on the school network.)  

**PLAY ROMS:** https://afterplay.io (browser-based emulation site, needs an account. Games are accesible across all devices, but you need to supply them yourself.)
